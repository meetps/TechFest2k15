All that is needed is a newly minted idea, a belief and a vision to spark a revolution. An idea is like a splendid bird that could articulate patterns emerging from chaos. Ideas can evolve and have a life of its own, striving to give the world a small nudge which will set the gears of change in motion on a broad scale."/>
