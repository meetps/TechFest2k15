Our feeders themselves are dying for the want of food and are burdened by debt. The farmers have become seeds that rot themselves to give fruits and flowers to others. They are being stepped on by everyone, crushed by the weight of selfishness, oppression, greed and apathy of all around them compelling them to end themselves."/>

Let your thoughts proliferate, let your ideas consolidate, and let your actions initiate a new form of transformation. "/>
